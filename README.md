# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains C++ based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

* [Singly Linked List](Singly%20Linked%20List/)
* [Doubly Linked List](Doubly%20Linked%20List/)
* [Queue](Queue/)
* [Stack](Stack/)
* [Hash Table](Dictionary/) (separate chaining)
* [Priority Queue](Binary%20Heap/)
* [Binary Search Tree](Binary%20Search%20Tree/) (BST)
* [Graph](Graph/) (both directed and undirected)
* [Set](Set/)

## Algorithms
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

* **Sorting**
  * [Bubble Sort](Sorting%20Algorithms/)
  * [Selection Sort](Sorting%20Algorithms/)
  * [Insertion Sort](Sorting%20Algorithms/)
  * [Radix Sort](Queue/)
* **Graphs**
  * [Depth-First Search](DFS/) (DFS)
  * [Spanning Tree](SpanningTree) - finding Spanning Tree for graph
